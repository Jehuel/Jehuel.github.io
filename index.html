					<p>when i was young i always wonder how computer system work and this motivate me to learn more about them. I choose RMIT because i feel like this university offers a lot in information technology and that i know i will learn heaps from this university.
					i expect to learn more about computer system and also how program works</p>

					<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
					
				</header>
				<p>A NAS or network attached storage, is the best way to keep your data backed up and stream or access content from devices connected to the network, keep all your content in one safe place on your home network instead of a remote server. But a NAS is really a PC that is connected to the network and that can be expensive compared to other options, especially as it includes hardware you don’t need for a NAS. </p>
				<p>Instead, ill will be using a Raspberry Pi with a hard drives or USB thumb drives to make a DIY NAS that is cheaper compare to buying retail versions, and it also reduces power consumption compared to NAS solutions that provides additional features you don’t really need, and it customizable using code from a code library available online for free which would be programmed using the Raspberry Pi. </p>
				<p>This Project will be useful to any student or even small business. Having a portable NAS is very useful for us students because most of us own a computer and we can relate to losing data, its hard when your hard drive fails and end up losing everything. With NAS you can avoid this situation on backing up all your files every time because files are saved on the NAS and can be accessed by your PC. Most of us student only own a laptop and we all know it lacks storage with Portable NAS everyone you want can access your file and not having trouble transferring it to another hard drive. It also makes sharing files more secure and it is easy access. </p>
				<p>I decided to design and implement a NAS Network utilizing a Raspberry PI and hard drive. I realised that most student who don’t own a laptop brings their USB Drive or a Hard drive containing files, assignment important document etc. Therefore, designing a NAS network with the capability of allowing each student to have his own account so that different students have separate account so that they can’t access each other’s files. This project offers cheap version of NAS not only the price is cheaper but also portable meaning you can bring it anywhere  </p>
				<p>For this project it requires basic knowledge in Raspberry pi programming and also Linux 
Required equipment for this project will be raspberry pi, external hard dive, USB cable, SD card, computer, and an active internet connection. Linux is free software and they also offer free study online, for raspberry pi and other equipment it easy to get online  
</p>
				<p>If this project is successful, this will help students overcome their problem with file storage. 
Using a DIY NAS compared to a market ready NAS is advisable as it is less expensive and easier to scale for larger sizes and additional service and features also, adding user accounts capability which we can code into raspberry pi  personally allows customers to have better control of the usability of their hardware which gives the freedom to code whatever we need and to add any service we require directly to the NAS Box by utilizing various and numerous online resource of code available for free
